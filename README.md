# Arduino Animator
A Python application to dynamically write C++ Arduino code to run an LED panel.

- **Description:** Supporting a friend's project, where they had constructed an Arduino powered RGB LED panel, they were then going on to manually writing the C++ code for over 100 individual RGB LEDs with the aid of hand drawn diagrams. I used my Python and QT programming knowledge to create a PyQT5 GUI driven Python application that would allow them to 'paint' their creations and then rapidly export the converted C++ code to Arduino.

- **What I Learned:** I further enhanced my PyQt skills by learning how to dynamically create GUI elements and then overload their signals and slots to grant me the control over the GUI that i required. I learned how to parse data into a C++ format ready for LED rendering.
